QS1.1: What data structure do you use for implementing DFS? Why?

    A1.1: DFS uses a stack to explore the deepest node first before backtracking. This provides a way to 
    track the nodes that have been expanded so they don't get expanded again. 

QS1.2:The Pacman board will show an overlay of the states explored, 
and the order in which they were explored (brighter red means earlier exploration). 
Is the exploration order what you would have expected? Does Pacman actually go to all 
the explored squares on his way to the goal?

    A1.2: No his exploration is not what I expected. I expected him to explore all of the states 
    to provide us with a visualization of his exploration but instead the pacman is going down 
    the path rather than the explored states. 

QS2.1: What data structure do you use for implementing BFS? Why?



QS3.1: What cost function did you implement?  Please briefly describe how your cost function is designed
(what factors does it consider and how heavy of a weight has each factor considered been given?)



QS4.1: What is the difference between the nullHeuristic  and the Manhattan distance heuristic? Does nullHeuristic give the optimal solution?  Why is the Manhattan distance heuristic better?



QS4.2: What happens on openMaze for the various search strategies?



QS5.1: What states representation do you choose in this problem?



QS5.2: Briefly  explain your implementation



QS6.1: What heuristic did you use for this corner problem?  Explain the potential strong points and 
weak points of your chosen heuristic.  Is your heuristic consistent?  Why?



QS7.1: What heuristic did you use for this problem?  Explain the potential strong points and weak points 
of your chosen heuristic.  Is your heuristic consistent?  Why?



QS8.1: Describe your solution and explain the potential strong points and weak points of your solution.
